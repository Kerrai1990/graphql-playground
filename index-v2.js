// Apollo Server 2.0 makes building the most powerful and production ready GraphQL 
// app easy. Apollo Server 1.x provided all of the tools necessary to make a great 
//APOLLO GRAPHQL v.1.0

// GraphQL backend, allowing the developer to pick and choose from a set of 
// unopinionated tools. Building on 1.x and fully backwards compatible, 2.0â€™s 
// defaults bake in the best practices and patterns gathered from two years of 
// community feedback and iteration. It is an opinionated, production focused, 
//GraphQL server that works with any backend.

  //A persisted query is an ID or hash that can be sent to the server in place of the 
  //GraphQL query string. This smaller signature reduces bandwidth utilization and speeds 
  //up client loading times. Apollo Server enables persisted queries without additional
  //server configuration, using an in-memory LRU cache to store the mapping between 
  //hash and query string. The persisted query cache can be configured as shown in the 
  //following code snippet.
